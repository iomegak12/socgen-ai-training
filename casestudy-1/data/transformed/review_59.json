  "review_text": "Reasonable rates with free breakfast and right in front of Gaylord National Resort worked for me very well. The rooms have good size bathrooms and the air conditioning in the rooms was excellent. Parking is 11 per day and that is why I did not give it 5 stars. However, at National Harbor 11 is not bad especially when Gaylord charges double of it per day.",
