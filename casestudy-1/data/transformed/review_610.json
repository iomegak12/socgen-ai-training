  "review_text": "Bad: We were not entirely satisfied with the buffet breakfast at the restaurant. The Westin should maybe think about adding a ommlett station, and a waffle station. Good: Rooms are great! Amenities are great! Location 1 block off the strip is great as you can escape from the hustle and bustle for a break to relax. Having 24hr access to pool and hot tub was also great! As relaxing and winding down in the hot tub at the end of your night or day is a real treat!",
