  "review_text": "Bad: Car was freshly washed before we arrived to valet the car. 3 days later, the car was filled with hard water marks from the sprinklers and now we need to get the car detailed to remove the spots. A bit frustrating to not get the car back in the same condition... Good: Location great, staff was pleasant, buffet was good and the chef that made the omelet was amazing",
