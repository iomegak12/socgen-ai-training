  "review_text": "Bad: Bed was a bit hard. Breakfast was all carbs, but was better than nothing. Good: Great location, right near two T stops and directly across from the Boston Public Library. Super nice staff. Great bar downstairs. Great price. We loved having music speakers overhead in main room and bathroom. Roomy, hot shower with great water pressure. Free continental breakfast with good coffee.",
