  "review_text": "Bad: The pool area was really disappointing. Very small and the service wasn't great. The bathroom in the room needed an upgrade. Needed a re-grouting in the shower, the sink had a huge crack in it and the sink made this weird gurgling noise when anyone above or below us turned on a tap. Good: The bed was comfortable.",
