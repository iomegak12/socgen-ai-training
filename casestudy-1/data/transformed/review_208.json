  "review_text": "Bad: The bed was stiff and valet parking only. Wifi is pay only and didn't live up to the speed expectations as advertised. Good: The location is great, easy access to all of Fremont area with a short walk. Not being a giant casino you don't have to walk far from the car or through the place to get out.",
  "review_title": "Easy access to Fremont, hope you like valet parking.",
