  "review_text": "Bad: The hotel has no real public areas, and there's a facilities fee which I didn't realize. The reception staff weren't that helpful. The room wasn't quiet enough for a really good night's sleep due to loud aircon and some other random noise that persisted even with aircon off. Good: The bed was comfortable with a really good sized bathroom. WiFi was good.",
