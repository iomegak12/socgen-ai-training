  "review_text": "Bad: Nothing!. Good: 1.Great location, although 1 block back from the strip it is very central and perhaps better than staying on the strip to the far left or right. 2. Value for money for the size and comfort of the room 3. Short walk from hotel room to lobby entry unlike most mega hotels in Vegas 4. Small bar/casino across the road with 1 beer... unheard of on the strip",
