  "review_text": "Bad: The room needs to be updated. The bathroom fixtures needs to be renovated. The layout of the room was a little a awkward, there needs to be better lighting and a vanity under the large mirror. The property itself could use use an update as well, it needs to be modernized. Good: It was close to all the activities on Fremont Street. I enjoyed being in the center of Downtown, everything was within walking distance.",
