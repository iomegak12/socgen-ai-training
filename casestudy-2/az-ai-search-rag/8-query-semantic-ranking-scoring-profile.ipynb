      "Yes, there are several cloud formations specific to oceans and large bodies of water:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Marine stratocumulus clouds are a persistent feature off the coasts of Peru and Chile over the Pacific Ocean. These low-level clouds are essentially fog and develop most often during the winter and early spring. They can be pushed inland by prevailing winds and are easily blocked by coastal mountains, often filling valleys that open to the ocean (page-15.pdf).\n",
      "- Ship tracks are narrow clouds that form over the ocean (e.g., the Pacific Ocean) when water vapor condenses around particles from ship exhaust. These clouds are often brighter than typical marine clouds and can stretch for hundreds of kilometers (page-31.pdf).\n",
      "- Cloud streets—parallel rows of clouds—form over regions like the Bering Strait in the Arctic Ocean when cold winds blow across warmer, moister ocean surfaces. These \"streets\" align with the wind direction and are a result of spinning cylinders of air (page-21.pdf).\n",
      "- Undular bores or solitary waves can form over the ocean, such as off the coast of Mauritania, where cool, dry air from land collides with warm, moist air over the Atlantic Ocean, creating a wave-like cloud pattern (page-23.pdf).\n",
      "- Low stratus clouds can develop over oceans, and their formation can be influenced by large objects like icebergs, as observed over iceberg A-56 in the South Atlantic Ocean (page-39.pdf).\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary: \n",
      "Specific cloud formations frequently observed over oceans and large bodies of water include marine stratocumulus, ship tracks from ship pollution, cloud streets from winds over sea ice, and undular bores formed by colliding air masses. Stratus clouds can also frame large obstacles such as icebergs (page-15.pdf, page-31.pdf, page-21.pdf, page-23.pdf, page-39.pdf).\n"
